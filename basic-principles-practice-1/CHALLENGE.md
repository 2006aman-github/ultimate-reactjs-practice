- Props: Outputting custom data on the same components


- Custom content within custom elements: Basically the info you can output that goes between opening and closing tags of your custom element.


- Style your components


- State Understanding and Management: One thing to keep in mind is that the this keyword, when passing in state, refers to the actual component. NOTE: The advantage is that you can manage and change the values from within state, and it'll change it in the places where you call it. For example, you can change a component when the user inputs something by changing the state. Remember that props are immutable, where as state is not.


- Event Handling: This is very correlated to state. Master this. NOTE: Convention for event handlers is to state what they do, and then to add the name handler to it, so developers know that you're executing it when the event is triggered.


- Referencing a function inside a stateful component, on a stateless component.


- Adding 2 way binding: This will help you so that you can record user input, and pass it to the UI. NOTE: TO BE CLEAR. It is 2 way binding because you're binding the onChange event to the value of the event. The method that makes that happen is bound to that event. And the 2nd binding happens when you use either value or defaultValue to set an initial value inside the input. That default value is bound to the input field

EXTRA CREDIT
- Using React Hooks Instead Of Class Components: Basically you need to be able to to refactor your class components to functional components and then use react hooks to assign the initial state, and to be able to change the state at will.
